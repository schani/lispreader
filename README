lispreader 0.1
==============

lispreader is a small library for reading expressions in Lisp
syntax. It has originally been written to facilitate simple exchange
of structured data between processes but its main purpose is now to
provide a framework for reading configuration files. To simplify
interpretation of the read data, lispreader also provides functions
for simple matching of expressions against patterns.
