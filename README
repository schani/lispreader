lispreader 0.5
==============

lispreader is a small library for reading expressions in Lisp
syntax. It has originally been written to facilitate simple exchange
of structured data between processes but its main purpose is now to
provide a framework for reading configuration files. To simplify
interpretation of the read data, lispreader also provides functions
for simple matching of expressions against patterns.

lispreader is also used in at least one application to read and write
data files. Lisp syntax is very suitable for doing this, especially if
the data is organized hierachically.
